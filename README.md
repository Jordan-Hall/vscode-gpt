# GPT-3 VS Code Plugin
Welcome to the GPT-3 VS Code Plugin, a tool that allows you to use the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model directly within your code editor.

## Features
 - Convert comments to code: Simply highlight a comment in your code and use the "Convert comments" command to generate code that matches the intent of the comment.

 - Convert unit tests to code: Select a block of unit test definitions and use the "Convert tests" command to generate code that matches the tests.

 - Execute GPT-3 on the current line: Use the "Execute on current line" command to generate code based on the current line of code you have selected.

- Execute GPT-3 on the full file: Use the "Execute on full file" command to generate code based on the entire file you have open.

## Getting Started
To use the GPT-3 VS Code Plugin, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Once you have your key, you can set it within the plugin settings by using the "Set API Key" command.

With your API key set, you can begin using the plugin by selecting a block of code or a comment, and then using one of the conversion commands listed above. The generated code will be added to a new file with a .gpt3.code extension, and opened in a new editor for you to review.
